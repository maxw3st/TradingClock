 TradingClock
FX trading clock app
This is a little clock for FX traders. It contains a drop down menu which allows the user to select the time in London, 
Paris, Tokyo, Sydney, and New York. Each timezone has its own clock tower image. The image serves as a button to close 
the app.

The app still has a couple bugs. The time does not always start running when the app is opened. If this happens, simply 
close and re-open it. The first time you select a new timezone from the menu it won't change from GMT (the default time). 
Make a second selection from the drop-down menu and the timezone selections will work from then on.

There are two versions of the app available at http://maxw3st.us/tradingClock/tradingClock.html. One has a light blue 
background, the other has a black background. I don't as yet have a certificate signing license, so the app will probably 
trigger security warnings and the JNLP launch feature won't work. The clock can be started by double clicking the .jar 
file in the dist folder. Alternatively, you can make a shortcut, using the jar file, and put it wherever is handy.
